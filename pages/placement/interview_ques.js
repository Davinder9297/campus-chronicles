       10. What is an Interface? </div>
       <div className=" text-left text-base font-serif"> An interface is a way of communicating between two objects. The objects can be software or hardware. An interface can be defined in many different ways, but the most common definition is that it is a way for one object to talk to another object. This communication can take many different forms, such as sending data to the other object, receiving data from the other object, or both. An interface can be implemented in many different ways, but the most common way is to use a software class. This class defines the interface and then other classes can use this class to implement the interface. When an object uses an interface, it is saying that it understands how the interface works and can use it to communicate with other objects.</div>

       11. What is an abstract class? </div>
       <div className=" text-left text-base font-serif"> An abstract class is a class that is not defined in the source code. Instead, it is defined in a file that contains a definition of the class. The file defines the class by defining all of the properties and methods of the class. However, the class does not have to be defined in the source code. Instead, it can be defined in a separate file that is included in the source code. The file can then be referenced by the source code. This allows the class to be abstract and still be defined in the source code. The main advantage of an abstract class is that it allows other classes to use the class without having to know all of its properties and methods. This makes it possible for other classes to use a class without knowing all of its properties and methods.</div>

       <div className=" text-left text-base font-serif"> A constructor is a function that is called when an object is created. A constructor is a function that takes a few arguments the type of object to be created, the initial state of the object, and the name of the class that will contain the object. When an object is created, it is passed to the constructor of the class that contains the object. A constructor can be used in many different ways. For example, a constructor can be used to initialize an array of objects or to initialize a variable that will be used by multiple objects. In these cases, it is important to use a constructor that takes only a few arguments.</div>

       <div className=" text-left text-base font-serif"> The thread is a fundamental concept in programming. It is a way of organizing and managing code so that it can run in parallel. The thread is a way of keeping code running in the background while the main program is running. Threads are used to parallelize tasks and to share resources among multiple threads. When the main program runs, it sends instructions to the thread that is running the task. When the task is done, the thread that was running the task sends instructions to the main program that is waiting for instructions. This process continues until all tasks are done or until one of them crashes or gets interrupted. Threads are a fundamental concept in programming because they allow programs to run in parallel and to share resources. They are also useful for managing memory and CPU usage</div>
